<p> I was driving to the club house and realized it was a beautiful day so I took a pic! I stopped get gas on the way there and realized that it is so darn expensive! I had a good day at work hanging out with Donald Duck. After work I came home to silly goofy sleeping again! After dinner I gave him a bath, he is always getting dirty! Later in the evening when I was going for a walk and saw Simba! He did not want to talk to me though.</p>
