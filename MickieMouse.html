<p> Beautiful day out! Driving to the club house! I realized that gas is so darn expensive. Had a good day at work, and came to silly goofy sleeping again! After dinner I gave him a bath, he is always geting dirty! Later in the evening when I was going for a walk and saw Simba! He did not want to talk to me though.</p>
